# ðŸš€ My DSA Journey â€“ Documented from Scratch

Iâ€™ve solved many DSA problems before â€” but without proper documentation or structure.

Now, starting fresh from may 2025:
- Every problem is re-solved from scratch
- Notes include thought process, dry runs, mistakes, and final clean code
- This GitHub repo will serve as my **personal guide + portfolio**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Crack product-based company interviews with clear understanding and solid revision.

ðŸ“‚ Folder structure:
- One folder per topic (e.g., Arrays, Linked List, Bit Manipulation)
- Each file has:
  - Problem statement link
  - Step-by-step reasoning
  - All attempts + debugging
  - Final clean code
