# ðŸš€ DSA Preparation Journey

ðŸ“… Started: May 2025

I had explored DSA earlier, but from **May 2025**, I restarted with a clear plan:

- Solving every problem from scratch
- Writing clean, structured code
- Documenting approach, mistakes, and key takeaways
- Organizing everything topic-wise for easy revision

This repo is my **complete DSA track record** â€” built with consistency, depth, and clarity.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Crack interviews at product-based companies with strong fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
