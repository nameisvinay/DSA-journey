# 🔗 Linked List – Problem Tracker

Tracking my understanding, mistakes, and final solutions.

---

## ✅ Completed

### [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
📌 Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: First LL problem. Used 3-pointer technique (`prev`, `curr`, `next`). Very comfortable.

### [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
📌 Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Classic slow and fast pointer technique. Implemented cleanly.

### [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)
📌 Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Straightforward iteration. Took care with null checks. Comfortable now.

### [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
📌 Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Iterative + dummy node approach used. Also practiced recursive version.

## 🔁 Needs Revisit

### [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
📌 Status: Revisit  
💡 Notes: Forgot **distance formula**. Review why `slow = head` works in phase two of Floyd’s algo.

### [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
📌 Status: Revisit  
💡 Notes: Off-by-one issue. Need cleaner understanding of gap technique and dummy head usage.

### [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
📌 Status: Revisit  
💡 Notes: Made mistakes managing **pointers inside sublist reversal**. Review edge cases and reconnection logic.

### [82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/)
📌 Status: Revisit  
💡 Notes: Missed logic for **skipping all duplicates**, not just one. Need to dry-run carefully.

## ❌ Need Full Rework

### [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)
📌 Status: Forgot  
💡 Notes: Complex pointer gymnastics. Couldn't manage head/k-group logic well. Start from scratch.
