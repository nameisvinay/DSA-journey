### ✅ Breakdown of How It Works:

```python
def isvalid(low, root, high):
    if root == None:
        return True
```

* Base case: If the node is `None`, it's valid — nothing to check.

```python
    if not low < root.val < high:
        return False
```

* Current node must lie **strictly between** the low and high bounds.
* If it breaks the BST rule, return `False`.

```python
    return isvalid(low, root.left, root.val) and isvalid(root.val, root.right, high)
```

* Recurse on:

  * Left child → upper bound becomes `root.val`
  * Right child → lower bound becomes `root.val`
* Combine with `and` to ensure **both** subtrees are valid.

---

### ✅ Final Touch — How to Call It:

Make sure to call like this **inside your main function**:

```python
return isvalid(float('-inf'), root, float('inf'))
```

So if this is your `isValidBST()` method in Leetcode:

```python
def isValidBST(self, root):
    def isvalid(low, root, high):
        if root == None:
            return True
        if not low < root.val < high:
            return False
        return isvalid(low, root.left, root.val) and isvalid(root.val, root.right, high)

    return isvalid(float('-inf'), root, float('inf'))
```

---

💡 This logic ensures:

* Every node is compared not just with its immediate parent
* But also with the **entire valid range** for its subtree
* We validate by maintaining bounds, not comparing siblings directly.
* Every subtree must also satisfy the BST condition based on its valid range.

My mistake:
    - i confused in passing treenode directly comparing with left and right child values.
    - passing root.left.val instead of root.left.
    - That means now you're passing an int as root, which breaks the next recursion step, since the function expects a TreeNode (to access         .left, .right, .val).

---

### 🔍 We are comparing **values** (i.e., integers), not the actual TreeNode objects.

So:

* `low`, `high` → are integers (like `-inf`, `inf`)
* `root.val` → is also an integer (the value inside the TreeNode)

---

### ✅ That’s why we write:

```python
if not low < root.val < high:
    return False
```

Because all 3 — `low`, `root.val`, and `high` — are **integers**.

---

### ❌ But doing this is wrong:

```python
if not low < root < high:  # ❌
```

That compares an `int < TreeNode < int`, which Python doesn't allow.

---

### 🔁 And when calling recursively:

We pass the **TreeNode** itself:

```python
isvalid(low, root.left, root.val)
```

because inside that call, you'll again need `root.left.val` and `root.left.left`, etc.

---

### 🔥 Recap:

| Purpose        | Value needed     |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| For comparison | Use `root.val` ✅ |
| For recursion  | Use `root` ✅     |
