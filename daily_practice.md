## 🚧 Gap-Filling & Deeper Variant DSA Problem Set

This list is carefully curated to complement existing 100+ problems with *high-quality*, *pattern-rich*, and *interview-critical* variants. Solving one per day alongside revision.

      | 🔁 Problem Style         | 🔎 Patterns to Think About       |
      | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
      | Searching something      | Binary Search, Hashing          |
      | Finding window/range     | Sliding Window                  |
      | Count pairs / inversions | Merge Sort, Two Pointers        |
      | Next/previous element    | Stack                           |
      | Subsets/combination      | Backtracking, Recursion         |
      | Circular / wrap-around   | Modulo + Fast/Slow Pointers     |
      | K-group or Reverse       | Linked List with extra handling |

### 🧠 Why I Used This Pattern:
- Needed to find max in subarray ⇒ used Sliding Window.
- Repeating elements & ranges ⇒ used Hashmap.
