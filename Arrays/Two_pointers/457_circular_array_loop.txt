my initial idea: 

  As seems like previous solved find duplicate number problem.
  so i did in same way.but i got stuck. logic is similar using pointers.

      here array with positive and negative values. and circular array.
      if negative move backward.
      if positive move forward.
              to do so, (i+nums[i]) % len(nums) - can help to take their places.

      ❌  here i mistaken to compare with i and nums[i] if both same then cycle found.
          the code i did wrong 
          
                  n = len(nums)
                  for i in range(n):
                      next_index = (i+nums[i])%n      
                      if next_index == nums[i]:        ❌  my mistake: next_index is actually a index , nums[i] is value. so cannot compare value with index.
                          return True
                  return False

              ---->  NOT VALID

    Also consider length should be more than 1. if not circular happens with self array.
