🔁 Pattern: Floyd’s Cycle Detection in Arrays
📚 Problem: [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
📈 Level   : Medium
==================================================================

initial Idea:

    Starting it seems very easy if solved using hash set.
    simply by adding all elements to set and if found element which already exists in set.
    then we found the duplicate return it.

    set --> space complexity - O(N)

    * But problem statement mentioned You’re not allowed to use extra space (so no set/hashmap)

    Also we can do another linear complexity : nums[i-1] == nums[i] return nums[i] --> but to make repeated elements to be in adjacent
    we need to sort.

    * which cant be modified as mentioned in array.


    so now points to remember : 
                        -  There are n+1 elements, but only n possible values →
                                    Pigeonhole Principle → at least one duplicate 🔁       
                        -  You’re not allowed to use extra space (so no set/hashmap)
                        -  You can’t sort the array, so sorting-based solution is invalid


    Each nums[i] is in [1, n]
    So you can treat:
              i → nums[i] → nums[nums[i]] → ...      Like a linked list traversal 
                                                    And if there’s a duplicate → some values must point to the same index
                  
                                    → That creates a cycle!
                                    
### 📌 Problem Summary:
- Given `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]`.
- Exactly **one number is repeated**, possibly multiple times.
- **Return the duplicate number** without modifying the array.
- Must use only **O(1)** extra space and run in **O(n)** time.


### 🧠 Apply Floyd’s Cycle Detection:

Absolutely buddy! Let’s **fully walk through how the array behaves like a linked list** — step by step — and how we trace the cycle like Floyd’s algorithm does.

## 🧩 Given Input:

```text
Index:  0   1   2   3   4
Value:  1   3   4   2   2
```

We treat each element as a **pointer to the next index**:

* `nums[i]` gives the **next jump**
* So if you're at index `i`, the next index is `nums[i]`

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step: How the "Linked List" Forms

Let’s start from `index 0`, and simulate the path as if we're walking through a linked list:


  ### ▶️ Step 1:
  
              Start at index `0`:
              → `nums[0] = 1`
              So go to index `1`
  
  ---
  
  ### ▶️ Step 2:
  
              Now at index `1`:
              → `nums[1] = 3`
              Go to index `3`
  
  ---
  
  ### ▶️ Step 3:
  
              Now at index `3`:
              → `nums[3] = 2`
              Go to index `2`
  
  ---
  
  ### ▶️ Step 4:
  
              Now at index `2`:
              → `nums[2] = 4`
              Go to index `4`

  ---
  
  ### ▶️ Step 5:
  
              Now at index `4`:
              → `nums[4] = 2`
              Go to index `2`
  
  ---
  
  ### ▶️ Step 6:
  
              Back at index `2` again
              → `nums[2] = 4`
              Go to index `4`
            
              → `nums[4] = 2`
              → Go back to index `2`

---

### 🔁 Cycle Detected:

    From here:   2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ...

A **cycle is formed** between index `2` and `4` (via values `4` and `2`)

---

## 🔁 Full Path:

          Start from index 0
          0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ...
                              ↑       ↓
                              └───────┘

---

### 🎯 Why This Works:

* Each value is a pointer (not a random number!)
* Duplicate value (in this case, `2`) means **two different positions** are pointing to the same index
* That causes the loop (just like a linked list cycle)

---

### 🧠 Floyd's Trick:

    * `slow = nums[slow]` → 1 step
    * `fast = nums[nums[fast]]` → 2 steps
    * Eventually `slow == fast` inside the loop
    * Then reset slow to `nums[0]` and both move 1 step to find where the loop **starts**

---


#### ✅ Phase 1: Detect Cycle (Meeting Point)
          
          slow = nums[0]
          fast = nums[0]
          while True:
              slow = nums[slow]           # 1 step
              fast = nums[nums[fast]]     # 2 steps
              if slow == fast:
                  break    # ✅ Exit the loop when cycle is detected

#### phase 2: Find start of the cycle (starting point)
          slow = nums[0]
          while slow != fast:
              slow = nums[slow]           # 1 step
              fast = nums[fast]           # 1 step
          return slow   # ✅ Duplicate number (entry point of cycle)


I tried to understand more by compare it with linked lists**.

> 💡 Can we do something like `fast is None` or `fast.next is None` in arrays, like we do in linked lists?

---

### ❓ In Linked Lists:

We usually write:

        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next


Why?

* Because `fast.next` might be `None` → so we check for null pointers to **avoid crashing**

---

### ❓ But in Arrays:

We **don’t use `.next`** — instead we follow **index-based hops**:

```python
fast = nums[nums[fast]]
```

So, no null pointers — **but**, we might go **out of bounds** if not careful.

---

### ✅ Why It’s Safe in Floyd’s Algo (for this problem):

The problem guarantees:

        > The input array 'nums' contains 'n + 1' numbers, where **each number is in the range [1, n].
        
        This means:
        
            * 'nums[i]' will always return a valid index
            * So:
                  nums[fast] → valid
                  nums[nums[fast]] → also valid
        
            Thus, there's **no need to check for `None`** or `IndexError`.

---

### 🛑 But: If This Guarantee Didn't Exist?

        If the problem didn't guarantee valid bounds, we would need:

                    while fast < len(nums) and nums[fast] < len(nums):
---

### 🔁 Summary:

| Structure            | How we stay safe                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linked List          | Check `fast` and `fast.next` is not `None`                |
| Array (this problem) | Safe due to constraints: all values are in `[1, n]` range |

---

Simply,
    > ❌ No need for `fast == None` or `fast.next == None` in arrays here
    > ✅ Because 'nums[nums[fast]]' is **always within bounds** in this problem
