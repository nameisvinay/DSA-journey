🧩 Problem: Subsets II
🔗 Link    : https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/
📚 Topic   : Recursion, Backtracking, Arrays
📈 Level   : Medium
==================================================================

📄 Description:
Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return *all possible subsets (the power set)*.

**The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.**

---

### ✅ Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

---

### 🧠 Intuition:

This is a variation of the classic **Subsets** problem.  
But because `nums` contains **duplicates**, we must avoid creating **duplicate subsets**.

Instead of backtracking with visited sets, we use an **iterative subset construction** approach, and carefully track which subsets were added in the last iteration to avoid repetition.

---

### 🚀 Core Idea:

We generate subsets by **iteratively adding each number to existing subsets**, but:

    - If current number is a **duplicate**, we only combine it with the subsets created in the **previous step**
    - We track the start index of those new subsets using `start = len(res)`
    - For unique numbers, we combine with all subsets

## 🔄 Dry Run: 'nums = [1, 2, 2]'

### 📌 After Sorting:

        nums = [1, 2, 2]
        res = [[]]

---

### 🔁 Iteration 1: 'nums[0] = 1'

      Not a duplicate. Add '1' to all subsets.
      
      | Existing Subset | + [1] | New Subset |
      | --------------- | ------ | ---------- |
      |  []             | +[1]   | [1]       |
      
      
      res = [
        [ ]        # 0
        [1]        # 1
      ]
      
      'start = 2' (next index to track new additions)

---

### 🔁 Iteration 2: 'nums[1] = 2'

Not a duplicate. Add '2' to all subsets.

            | Existing Subset | +  [2] | New Subset |
            | --------------- | ------ | ---------- |
            |  []             | + [2]  |  [2]       |
            |  [1]            | + [2]  |  [1,2]     |


res = [
  [ ]        # 0
  [1]        # 1
  [2]        # 2 ← added now
  [1,2]      # 3 ← added now
]

start = 4

---

### 🔁 Iteration 3: 'nums[2] = 2' (⚠️ duplicate)

    So, only add '2' to the subsets **created in the last iteration**:
      → That is, only 'res[2]' and 'res[3]' → '[2]', '[1,2]'
    
          | Existing Subset | + [2] | New Subset |
          | --------------- | ------ | ---------- |
          |  [2]            | +[2]   | [2,2]     |
          |  [1,2]          | +[2]   | [1,2,2]   |


    res = [
      [ ]         # 0
      [1]         # 1
      [2]         # 2
      [1,2]       # 3
      [2,2]       # 4 ← added now
      [1,2,2]     # 5 ← added now
    ]

          Iteration 0:  nums[0] = 1
          ──────────────────────────────
          res = 
          [ ]       ← base
          [1]       ← [] + 1
          
          start = 2
          

          Iteration 1:  nums[1] = 2
          ──────────────────────────────
          res = 
          [ ]       ← base
          [1]       ← from prev
          [2]       ← [] + 2
          [1,2]     ← [1] + 2
          
          start = 4
          

          Iteration 2:  nums[2] = 2 (duplicate)
          ─────────────────────────────────────
          res =
          [ ]         ← base
          [1]         ← from earlier
          [2]         ← from last round
          [1,2]       ← from last round
          [2,2]       ← [2] + 2
          [1,2,2]     ← [1,2] + 2
          
          start = 6


---

### ✅ Final Output:
      
        [[], [1], [2], [1,2], [2,2], [1,2,2]]

## ✅ Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res = [[]]
        start = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                temp_start = start
            else:
                temp_start = 0
            
            start = len(res)
            for j in range(temp_start, len(res)):
                res.append(res[j] + [nums[i]])
        
        return res
```

## 🧠 Time and Space Complexity

      * **Time:**  O(2^n) → Number of subsets in power set
      * **Space:** O(2^n) → Resultant subset list

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

    * Sort the input to handle duplicates correctly
    * Use 'start = len(res)' to know which subsets were added in the previous round
    * When encountering a duplicate, only extend the subsets added in the last round
    * This technique is useful in similar problems like:

  * `Combination Sum II`
  * `Permutations II`
  * Backtracking with duplicates
