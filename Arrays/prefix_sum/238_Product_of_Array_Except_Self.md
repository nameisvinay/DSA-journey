üß© Problem: Product of Array Except Self  
üîó Link    : https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/  
üìö Topic   : Arrays  
üìà Level   : Medium  
==================================================================

## üìù Description:
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

- You must solve it **without using division**
- In **O(n)** time complexity.
- Optimize space too if possible.

---

## ‚ùå Brute Force Approach (TLE)
For each index, loop over the array and calculate product of all elements **except the current index**.

### üîç Thought Process:
- For every `i`, do another loop and multiply everything except `i`
- Store result in an output array

### ‚õî Mistake:
- Time complexity is **O(n¬≤)**
- Works for small input but will timeout

---

## üîÅ My First Optimized Attempt (with Prefix and Suffix arrays)
I tried using two arrays:
- `prefix[i]` stores product of all elements to the left
- `suffix[i]` stores product of all elements to the right

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue I Faced:
```py
for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
    prod = 1
    for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
        prod *= nums[j]
    suffix[i] = prod
````

I realized this loop runs in O(n¬≤). So even though it *looked* optimal, it was still brute inside.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Optimal Approach (O(n) Time, O(1) Extra Space)

### ‚ú® Idea:

* First pass: compute prefix product and store in answer\[]
* Second pass (from reverse): keep multiplying suffix and update answer\[i]

### üìå Observation:

* I started loop from `1` (not `0`) for prefix since `answer[0]` stays `1`
* Similarly, suffix starts from `n-2` as last index is `1` by default

### ‚úÖ My Final Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = [1] * len(nums)

        # Prefix product pass
        prod = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            prod *= nums[i-1]
            answer[i] = prod

        # Suffix product pass
        prod = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            prod *= nums[i+1]
            answer[i] *= prod

        return answer
```

---

## üîç Dry Run:

For input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`

* Prefix: `[1,1,2,6]`
* Suffix: `[24,12,4,1]`
* Final:  `[24,12,8,6]`

---

## üß† What I Learned:

* Prefix + Suffix pattern can avoid division
* Two-pass problems are common in arrays
* O(1) extra space means ignoring the output array
* Careful about loop boundaries, especially in reverse pass
