ğŸ’¡ Next greater:
```
   when we are looking for future elements (next greater), it's better to traverse from right to left(reversed).
```

ğŸ’¡ subsets-II:
```
   len(res) actually gives us the index where we should start forming new subsets in the next step â€” especially when handling duplicates.
```

ğŸ’¡ Binary search loop condition:
```
    | Use Case                                                  | Loop Condition |
    | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | You want to find **exact index**                          | `while l <= r` |
    | You want to **narrow** to one point (like min/first/last) | `while l < r`  |
 ```

ğŸ’¡ Sliding window:
```
| Condition      | Meaning                                  | Window Adjustment Logic                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **At Most K**  | You can have **â‰¤ K** distinct characters | Shrink window only when distinct chars **> K**    |
| **At Least K** | You need **â‰¥ K** distinct characters     | Shrink only when distinct chars **< K**           |
| **Exactly K**  | You need **== K** distinct characters    | Shrink when **> K**, and count only when **== K** |
```

ğŸ’¡ Arrays:
```
* ğŸ”¹ **Direct value iteration (`for val in arr`) is faster than index-based access (`arr[i]`)** when the index isn't needed.
* ğŸ”¹ **Using built-in `min()` / `max()` is faster than manual `if` checks** for comparisons during iteration.
```
