* Next greater
 ðŸ’¡ when we are looking for future elements (next greater), it's better to traverse from right to left(reversed).

* subsets-II
 ðŸ’¡ len(res) actually gives us the index where we should start forming new subsets in the next step â€” especially when handling duplicates.

*  Binary search loop condition:
 ðŸ’¡ | Use Case                                                  | Loop Condition |
    | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | You want to find **exact index**                          | `while l <= r` |
    | You want to **narrow** to one point (like min/first/last) | `while l < r`  |
