```
  ðŸ’¡ Next greater:
   when we are looking for future elements (next greater), it's better to traverse from right to left(reversed).
```

```
  ðŸ’¡ subsets-II:
   len(res) actually gives us the index where we should start forming new subsets in the next step â€” especially when handling duplicates.

  ðŸ’¡ Binary search loop condition:
    | Use Case                                                  | Loop Condition |
    | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | You want to find **exact index**                          | `while l <= r` |
    | You want to **narrow** to one point (like min/first/last) | `while l < r`  |
 ```

| **At Most K**  | You can have **â‰¤ K** distinct characters | Shrink window only when distinct chars **> K**    |
| **At Least K** | You need **â‰¥ K** distinct characters     | Shrink only when distinct chars **< K**           |
| **Exactly K**  | You need **== K** distinct characters    | Shrink when **> K**, and count only when **== K** |
