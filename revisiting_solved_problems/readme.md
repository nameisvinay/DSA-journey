# 🚀 DSA Revision Journey

A clean and structured roadmap of my DSA mastery — focused, consistent, and built after overcoming a long gap.

---

## 📂 Arrays

✅ Two Sum (#1)  
🗒️ Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: One of the first I solved cleanly after restarting. Nailed logic.

---

## 📂 Linked List

✅ Reverse LL (#206)  
🗒️ Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Simple and solid — 3-pointer pattern clicked well.

✅ Cycle I (#141)  
🗒️ Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Fast-slow pointer intuition is sharp now.

🔁 Cycle II (#142)  
🗒️ Status: Needs Revisit  
💡 Notes: Forgot the distance math. Need 1 more pass.

✅ Middle LL (#876)  
🗒️ Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Easy — direct use of slow pointer.

🔁 Remove Nth (#19)  
🗒️ Status: Buggy Indexing  
💡 Notes: Edge case off-by-one, revisit soon.

🔁 Reorder LL (#143)  
🗒️ Status: Merge part tricky  
💡 Notes: Need one more clean dry-run.

❌ Add Two Numbers (#2)  
🗒️ Status: Forgot Logic  
💡 Notes: Felt blank. Prioritize in next round.

## 📂 Stack

✅ Valid Parentheses (#20)  
🗒️ Status: Confident  
💡 Notes: Classic stack problem — clean and fast.

---

## 📂 Sliding Window

❌ Sliding Max (#239)  
🗒️ Status: Need Full Revisit  
💡 Notes: Forgot deque handling — revisit from scratch.

### 🔄 Status Key:
- ✅ Confident → Can solve without help  
- 🔁 Needs Revisit → Bugs, unclear logic, needs one more pass  
- ❌ Forgot → Need full rework, didn't remember approach

📌 *Tracking every challenge — not just problems, but my growth too.*
